# Socpowerbud XT

**Socpowerbud XT** is an advanced power and performance monitoring suite designed specifically for Apple Silicon devices.

The project is divided into two distinct product lines to cater to different needs:

* **Socpowerbud XTs**: A modern, beautiful GUI application built with SwiftUI and \"Liquid Glass\" design language.
* **Socpowerbud XT**: A lightweight, pure CLI tool for terminal enthusiasts and developers, providing granular data output.

## 🚀 Download and Installation

**This software is for internal preview only. Please join the QQ Group to receive the download link and the latest version!**

**Official QQ Group: [Click here to join the infodrop.cn QQ Group](https://infodrop.cn/?open=auth)**

**To ensure software stability and prevent unauthorized distribution during the beta phase, mandatory online authentication is required upon launch.**

* **Data Collection**: The software will collect your device's Chip Model (and basic IORep structure for debugging) to validate compatibility.
* **Requirement**: You must accept the license agreement and have an active internet connection to run.
* **Privacy**: No personal data beyond hardware identifiers is collected.

> **Note**: **iOS XTs** is designed for TrollStore or standard signing. **iOS XTs-JB** is optimized for Jailbroken environments (Rootful/Rootless) with extended entitlements.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Apple Silicon |
| **Socpowerbud XTs (GUI)** | **macOS 13.0+** (Ventura) or **iOS 16.0+** |
| **Socpowerbud XT (CLI)** | **macOS 11.0+** (Big Sur) or **iOS 11.0+** |

## ✅ Chip Support Status

While Socpowerbud XT can detect the model identity of almost all Apple Silicon devices, full power telemetry requires specific hardware sensor mapping.

> **Note**: Devices marked as "Detected" will launch and identify the chip model correctly, but the dashboard will show empty graphs and 0 values.
## 🖥️ Socpowerbud XT (CLI) Usage

The CLI version is a standalone binary that provides detailed telemetry identical to low-level engineering tools. 

**Note:** You do **not** need `sudo` to run this tool. It works with standard user privileges as long as the binary is correctly signed with the necessary entitlements.

### Basic Command

```bash
# Run with default settings (1.0s refresh)
./socpowerbud-xt

# Run with a specific refresh interval (e.g., 0.5 seconds)
./socpowerbud-xt -i 0.5
```

### Output Explanation

The CLI outputs a structured view of the SoC's power state:

* **Unmapped E**: Power rails not assigned to specific cores (System overhead).
* **ANE**: Apple Neural Engine frequency and voltage.
* **Clusters**: Detailed breakdown of E-Cores and P-Cores, including:
    * Frequency (MHz)
    * Voltage (mV)
    * Power (mW)
    * Residency (Active vs Idle %)
    * **DVFS Distribution**: A histogram of time spent at each frequency state.
                    
## 📱 Socpowerbud XTs (GUI) Usage

### Local Monitoring
Simply launch the app. The dashboard will visualize real-time metrics using the adaptive Liquid Glass interface.

### Remote Monitoring (Cross-Device)
Turn your iPhone/iPad into a dedicated dashboard for your Mac:

1.  Ensure both devices are on the same LAN/Wi-Fi.
2.  **Host**: Run **XTs** (macOS) or **XT** (CLI) on the device you want to monitor.
3.  **Client**: Run **XTs** on your viewing device (iOS/macOS).
4.  Tap the device menu in the header and select the Host.
